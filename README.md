# HackingMiniGame
a hacking mini game inspired by the mini game in Fallout

## Origin
This Kata was from the /r/dailyProgrammer subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3qjnil/20151028_challenge_238_intermediate_fallout/).

### Explination
  I attempted to utilize the retrolambda library in order to use this in future Android projects.I initially started to build an android game from this but I decided to get a basic version and build the android game as a seperate project which lets me experiment with Animations in Android.
